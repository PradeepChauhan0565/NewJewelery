                           A diamond necklace is part of the jewelry essentials that every woman must own. 
                           It is one of the go-to accessories to dress up any outfit.  It is a beautiful investment 
                           that you can wear countless times and it will never fail

                            Diamond necklaces come in all shapes and sizes, in varying budgets and differing styles. 
                            How do you know which one to pick? 
                            <br><br>
                            We have highlighted a few points to consider to help you select the 
                            perfect diamond necklace that you will cherish forever.

                        Diamond Quality
                    </h2>

                            When looking at a necklace, keep the diamond quality in mind.  This is determined by 
                                        the 4C’s – cut, clarity, color and carat of the diamonds used in the necklace. The lesser 
                                        the inclusions, higher the cost. A colorless and transparent diamond will also cost more 
                                        because they are harder to find. While the size or carat is also important, the cut of the 
                                        diamond dictates the level of brilliance that the stone has. The number of facets and the
                                        length-to-width ratio plays an integral role in determining how radiant your diamond necklace 
                                        is going to be and its ability to catch the light from 
                                        all angles, making you and your necklace the stand out in the crowd.

                                        The next stage is to look at different styles like tennis necklace, diamonds by the yard, 
                                        cluster set diamonds, etc.

                                            A <a href="https://www.kamajewelry.com/details/jnj000220-JNJ000220">tennis necklace</a> is one that has a continuous strand of diamonds set meticulously
                                            for maximum impact. It is an elegant and a classic design that can never go out of style. 
                                                Tennis necklaces are usually shorter and worn closer to the neckline. They are either 16’’ or
                                                18’’ and are mostly crafted in white gold but 
                                            then again yellow and rose gold are also gaining prominence.  
                                            <br><br>
                                            The diamonds used in the necklace can be either small or large, depending on your 
                                            budget and personal preference. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            The tennis necklace gets its name from the 1987 US Open. Tennis champion Chris Evert
                                            stopped her match and asked everyone to look for her diamond bracelet which had broken and
                                                fallen off her wrist. When she spoke to the media later, she referred to it as her tennis 
                                                bracelet. The name stuck and soon enough everyone wanted tennis bracelets.
                                            Tennis necklaces were then created to match the look of a tennis bracelet. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            The cost of a tennis bracelet varies on the metal, amount of diamonds used and the size of
                                                diamonds. We have many tennis necklaces set in 14- karat to make them more affordable. 
                                                You can opt for this 14-karat dual toned 
                                            tennis necklace set with round diamonds totaling 2.02 carats.

                                                <br><br>

                                                One of the reasons why tennis necklaces are popular is because they are versatile. Celebrities have been spotted wearing this style to
                                                red carpet events and with same effortless ease to the beach and even to the gym!  
                                                <br><br>
                                                The ones with larger diamonds may be more suitable for evening wear but daintier versions can be worn anywhere and anytime. You can even

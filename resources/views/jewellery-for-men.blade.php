                           More and more men are including jewellery in the accessories that they wear to express their 
                           personal style. They are going beyond their engagement
                            and wedding rings to flaunt chains, layered necklaces, stackable rings, bracelets and more.

                          Male celebrities are leading this trend by not only picking precious jewels for special occasions 
                          and red-carpet events but also incorporating them in their every day style files. Harry Styles
                           has been spotted on multiple occasions wearing gold necklaces, a cross pendant, 
                          pearl earrings and necklace (on different occasions) and playing it up with different rings.

                          F1 driver Lewis Hamilton loves his jewelry so much that he has had to put a fight with the
                           Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to let him keep some of his jewelry on
                            during races.  Singers Shawn Mendes and Justin 
                          Bieber, too, keep their daily wear fashionable with minimal chains and pendants.

                          If you are looking to amp up your look with some jewelry, here are 
                          a few points to help you in your search for the perfect piece.

                        Before you begin your search, it is better to have an idea of what kind of jewelry you want. 
                        Take the following parameters into consideration while drawing up a visual image.

                        Are you looking for something in silver, gold or platinum? It all depends on your personal preference.
                         Do you want it to be simple and plain or accented with diamonds or gemstones? If you are looking at
                          something with diamonds, familiarize yourself with the 4C’s – cut, color, clarity and carat and
                           decide what range your stone should fall under.
                         Determine the caratage that you are looking for when it comes to gold jewelry.  
                </p>

                 <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                       Are you looking for something understated like platinum or white gold or a warmer tone of yellow 
                       or rose gold? If you are confused about
                        platinum or white gold, read about the difference in our platinum buying guide.

                      Have a broad budget in mind. It will help you significantly eliminate products that are out of 
                      your desirable price range. If you want the look of gold but it is too costly,
                       consider lower cartage gold like 14K or gold-plated silver jewelry.

                      Tell stories about who you are as a person through your fine jewels. Are you looking for something minimal,

                <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                      Rings are an easy way to add some sparkle to your look. There is a whole ocean of options 
                      from minimalistic bands in gold and platinum to diamond-encrusted
                       rings like this <a href="https://www.kamajewelry.com/details/1-34ct-square-statement-ring-JRX025817">Square Statement Ring</a> that brings out your flamboyant side.

                      Signet rings are also gaining popularity. Traditionally, gentlemen involved in business or 
                      politics would wear signet rings on their pinky finger. They would be engraved with their
                       family crest and would be used as a seal to sign important documents. They have come along way 
                      since then and you can pick your own signet ring to make a mark in this world.

                   Chains and pendants are also an option in gold, platinum or dual-tone designs. 
                   Think about what length you want the chain to be – closer to your neck or chest as well as
                    the thickness of the chain. It plays an integral role int the overall look.  
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                  You could go all out with quirky pendants or one that has a deeper meaning. If you want 
                  to stick to something safe or connect with a higher spirituality, cross pendants are back in 
                  fashion. Check out this <a href="https://www.kamajewelry.com/details/1-13-ct-simple-cross-statement-pendant-JPR01221Q">simple cross pendant studded with 1.3 carats of diamonds.</a>.

                <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                 For a bolder look, don’t be afraid of layering your chains to express your multi-faceted personality. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                When it comes to bracelets, you could start off with beaded and leather cord bracelets and work your way up to ones crafted in 
                gold and platinum, and ones with diamonds and gemstones as well. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                If this is your first time buying jewelry for yourself or another male, shopping for jewelry
                 might be confusing but always remember to pick out something that you connect with. Leave
                  the norms and gender rules behind. 
                \It’s how you wear a piece of jewelry and what it means to you that matters.

                                                The 4Cs of a diamond – cut, color, clarity and carat are important 
                                                parameters to keep in mind while buying diamond jewelry.

                                            <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                                                While most people thing that a bigger diamond will sparkle more, the cut of the diamond is crucial. The number of facets, the angle of the facets, the symmetry and alignment of the shape all affect the diamond’s ability to reflect light and its propensity to sparkle. 
                                                The shape of a diamond can affect the price of a diamond by as much as 30 percent.

                                            <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                                                A round brilliant cut diamond is one of the most sought-after diamond cuts because of its
                                                inherent power to sparkle the brightest. It accounts for roughly 50 
                                                percent of diamonds sold in USA, the largest market for diamond jewelry. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                                                When it comes to color, ideally diamonds rated through D and F are considered colorless diamonds
                                                but you can also pick a nearly colorless diamond in the GH range. Inclusions won’t be easily
                                                detectable in a diamond pendant so you can choose a clarity grade of SI1 or SI2 for your pendant. 
                                                We have plenty of options in this color and clarity.

                                                White gold is often the preferred choice for diamond jewelry because of its neutral
                                                color that allows it to be paired with any outfit. It is a symbol of timelessness and
                                                modernity. But a diamond set in yellow or rose gold looks just as beautiful. The warmth of
                                                yellow gold beautifully contrasts the luminosity of the diamond while pink or rose gold
                                                    brings a sense of softness and romance with it.

                                                When it comes to the design of your pendant, it depends on what kind of

                                                If you want something that is classic, pick a 4-prong set solitaire. The setting allows maximum

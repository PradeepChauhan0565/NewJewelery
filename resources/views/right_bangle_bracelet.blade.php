                         The famed pre-historic bronze ‘Dancing Girl’ statue circa 2500 BCE discovered in Mohenjo 
                         Daro depicts a girl whose one hand is completely beautified with bangles. From then on till
                          now bangles and bracelets continue to be must-have ornaments to adorn your hands. In Indian

                       Buying a gold or diamond bangle online can seem a little bit daunting at first.
                        The fist thought that crosses though your
                        mind is, ‘Am I buying the right size?’ or ‘Will it fit me properly?’  
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                    There are plenty of guides to measure your hand and identify the right bangle size for yourself.
                     You could also get your existing bangle size measured to be sure of your size. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify; color:#00263a;">
                    While picking out your bangle, you should be able to fit in or slip two fingers comfortably in it. A bangle that is too tight,
                     will make your wrist appear bigger while one that is loose will keep rolling up and down your arm.

                       Depending on your personal preference and occasion you can select a more minimalistic or
                        bold wrist ornament set with diamonds. It is important to consider the 4Cs of the diamonds
                        – color, clarity, cut and carat weight – used in the bangle or bracelet.

                    Tennis bracelets have an enduring appeal and can add glamour to any occasion. These refer to 
                    the continuous placement of diamonds along the bracelet. The style became popular in the 1920s 
                    when women wore it to the fanciest parties. The bracelet is so comfortable that tennis star Chris 
                    Evert even wore it during her tournaments. In fact, that’s how the bracelet got its name. In 1978 
                    during the US Open Evert lost her diamond bracelet mid-match. The game was stopped so that she could 
                    look for it. Evert referred to it as her tennis bracelet and the name stuck on.
